# generator-browserifycordova [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/joaosa/generator-browserifycordova.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joaosa/generator-browserifycordova)

Feeling uneasy when your perfectly good browserifiable apps have to fit into a Cordova-specific layout?

Voil√°! Problem solved.

Your browserifiable apps can now be wrapped by Apache Cordova and live on the mobile side of life, while you can code in a perfectly normal Node.js Grunt project layout.

This [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator was based on [[eugeneware/generator-nodejs](https://github.com/eugeneware/generator-nodejs), [yeoman/generator-node](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-nodel) and [dangeross/generator-cordova](https://github.com/dangeross/generator-cordova).

## Getting Started

- Firstly install:
  - the SDKs you fancy (i.e. Android, iOS, FirefoxOS, etc)
  - Apache Cordova `npm install -g cordova`
  - Yo `$ npm install -g yo`

### Yeoman Generators

Yeoman travels light. He didn't pack any generators when he moved in. You can think of a generator like a plug-in. You get to choose what type of application you wish to create, such as a Backbone application or even a Chrome extension.

To install generator-browserifycordova from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-browserifycordova
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo browserifycordova
```

### Getting To Know Yeoman

Yeoman has a heart of gold. He's a person with feelings and opinions, but he's very easy to work with. If you think he's too opinionated, he can be easily convinced.

If you'd like to get to know Yeoman better and meet some of his friends, [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io), check out the complete [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Getting-Started).
